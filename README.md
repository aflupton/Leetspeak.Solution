## Description

_An app that translate user text inputs into the pseudo internet language 'leetspeak'._

* _The letter "e" should be replaced with "3"._
* _The letter "o" should be replaced with "0"._
* _The capital letter (not the lower case), "I", should be replaced with "1"._
* _The letter "t" should be replaced with "7"._
* _All instances of "s" should be replaced with "z" UNLESS it is the first letter of the word._


_For example, an input of "Epicodus" would become "3p1c0duz", "Ignite" would become "1gni73", "String" would become "S7ring", and "Exercises" would become "3x3rciz3z"._
